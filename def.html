		<h1>Variable Definition in C++</h1>
		<p>A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type, and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows −</p>
		<h3>type variable_list;</h3>
		<p>Here, type must be a valid C++ data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool or any user-defined object, etc., and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here −</p>
		<h3>int    i, j, k;</h3>
		<h3>char   c, ch;</h3>
		<h3>float  f, salary;</h3>
		<h3>double d;</h3>
		<p>The line int i, j, k; both declares and defines the variables i, j and k; which instructs the compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.
Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows −
</p>
		<h3>type variable_name = value;</h3>
		<h3>Some examples are −</h3>

			For definition without an initializer: variables with static storage duration are implicitly initialized with NULL (all bytes have the value 0); the initial value of all other variables is undefined.
