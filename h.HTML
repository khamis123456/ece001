		<h1>A Brief History of C++</h1>
		<p>C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup while he was working for AT&T Bell Labs,
which eventually packaged and marketed it. Initial versions of the language were
made available internally at AT&T beginning in 1981. C++ steadily evolved in
response to user feedback.
The first edition of Stroustrup’s book, The C++ Programming Language, was
published in early 1986. In 1989 with the release of Version 2.0, C++ was rapidly
acknowledged as a serious, useful language. In that year, work began on establishing
an internationally recognized language standard for C++.
Standardization under the control of ANSI (American National Standards
Institute) Committee X3J16 began in 1989 and was completed and published internally in 1997 by the X3 Secretariat under the title Draft Standard—TheC++ Language, X3J16/97-14882, Information Technology Council (NSITC),
