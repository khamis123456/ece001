		<h1>Let us look at the various parts of the above program :</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>	The C++ language specifies multiple headers that contain either necessary or useful information for your application. The header < iostream > is needed for that program</li>
			<li>	The line which uses std namespace; tells the compiler to use namespace std. Namespaces are an addition to C++, relatively recently.</li>
			<li>	The next row '/ main) (is where the execution of the program starts.' is a single-line comment available in C++. Comments on a single line start with / and stop at line end.</li>
			<li>	The line int main) (is the main function where the execution of the program commences.</li>
			<li>	The next line cout < < < "Hello World"; causes the "Hello World" message to appear on the screen.</li>
			<li>	The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.</li>
		</ul>
